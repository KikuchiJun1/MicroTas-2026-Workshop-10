# MicroTAS 2026 Workshop 10: Artificial Intelligence for Single-Cell Analysis: Detection, Segmentation, Classification, and Tracking

This repository contains two hands-on tutorials for biomedical image analysis using classical and deep learning approaches:

1. **Segmentation Tutorial** - Cell segmentation using classical methods (Otsu thresholding) and UNet
2. **Classification Tutorial** - Sperm morphology classification using DenseNet-169

Both tutorials are designed for beginners and can run in Google Colab with free GPU access. However, GPU is recommended for extensive training on data.

## Tutorial 1: Segmentation

### Overview
Learn nucleus segmentation on the NuInsSeg dataset using:
- **Classical methods**: Otsu thresholding, morphological operations
- **Deep learning**: UNet architecture for semantic segmentation

### What You'll Learn
- Image preprocessing and visualization
- Classical segmentation techniques
- Training a lightweight UNet (10 epochs)
- Evaluation metrics: Dice coefficient and IoU
- Inference on new images

### Dataset
- **NuInsSeg** (subset: human spleen tissue)
- ~40 image/mask pairs for fast training
- Binary segmentation (nucleus vs. background)

### Expected Results
- **Classical (Otsu)**: Dice ~0.60-0.70
- **UNet (10 epochs)**: Dice ~0.85-0.95

### Runtime
- **GPU (Colab)**: ~10-15 minutes
- **CPU**: ~30-45 minutes

### Key Features
- Runs entirely in the browser (no local setup)
- Pretrained weights available for inference
- Modular code with detailed comments

---

## Tutorial 2: Classification

### Overview
Binary classification of sperm morphology (Normal vs. Abnormal) using:
- **DenseNet-169** pretrained on ImageNet
- Transfer learning approach

### What You'll Learn
- Data augmentation for medical images
- Transfer learning with pretrained models
- Training with PyTorch DataLoaders
- Model evaluation and confusion matrices

### Dataset
- TIFF/PNG images of sperm cells
- Two classes: Normal and Abnormal
- ImageFolder structure for easy loading

### Expected Results
- **5 epochs**: Validation accuracy ~75-80%
- **75 epochs (pretrained)**: Validation accuracy ~77%

### Runtime
- **GPU (Colab)**: ~5-10 minutes (5 epochs)
- **CPU**: ~20-30 minutes (5 epochs)

### Key Features
- 800×800 image resolution
- Grayscale normalization (mean=0.2636, std=0.1562)
- Pretrained checkpoint included for evaluation

---

## Prerequisites

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.13+
- torchvision
- Pillow, NumPy, Matplotlib
- scikit-image (for segmentation only)

### Hardware
- **Recommended**: GPU with 4GB+ VRAM (free in Colab)
- **Minimum**: CPU with 8GB RAM

---

## Usage Instructions

### Segmentation Tutorial

1. **Open in Colab** using the badge above
2. **Run Setup Cells** (1-4) to clone repo and download weights
3. **Follow the notebook sequentially**:
   - Data exploration
   - Classical segmentation demo
   - UNet training (10 epochs)
   - Pretrained inference
4. **Experiment**: Adjust `LIMIT`, `EPOCHS`, `IMG_SIZE` in Setup Cell 3

### Classification Tutorial

1. **Open in Colab** using the badge above
2. **Mount Google Drive** (if dataset is stored there)
3. **Update `CFG.data_dir`** to point to your dataset
4. **Run all cells** to train for 5 epochs
5. **Evaluate** using the pretrained checkpoint section

---

## Evaluation Metrics

### Segmentation
- **Dice Coefficient**: Overlap between prediction and ground truth
  - Formula: `2 * |A ∩ B| / (|A| + |B|)`
  - Range: 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect match)
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Also known as Jaccard Index
  - Formula: `|A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|`

### Classification
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision/Recall**: Per-class performance
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of predictions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Segmentation

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'train_unet'`  
**Solution**: Ensure you ran Setup Cell 1 to clone the repository

**Issue**: `RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory`  
**Solution**: Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` or `IMG_SIZE` in Setup Cell 3

**Issue**: Pretrained weights fail to download  
**Solution**: Training will proceed normally; newly trained model will be used for inference

### Classification

**Issue**: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './Data/Train'`  
**Solution**: Update `CFG.data_dir` to your dataset location

**Issue**: Poor validation accuracy  
**Solution**: Train for more epochs (increase `CFG.epochs`) or check data quality
