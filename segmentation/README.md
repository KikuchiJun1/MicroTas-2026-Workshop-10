# MicroTas 2026 Workshop 10: Segmentation Tutorial

Welcome to the **Image Segmentation Tutorial**! This repository contains a hands-on workshop combining classical computer vision techniques with deep learning using PyTorch and UNet.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll explore:
- **Classical Segmentation**: Grayscale conversion, Otsu thresholding, morphological operations (opening/closing), and evaluation metrics (Dice, IoU).
- **Deep Learning Segmentation**: Training a small UNet model on real tissue images.
- **Inference**: Loading pretrained weights and running predictions on new images.

All of this runs in **~30-45 minutes** with GPU support (recommended) on Google Colab.

## Dataset

We use a subset of the **NuInsSeg dataset** (human spleen tissue images with binary segmentation masks):
- Small subset included in this repository for quick runs.
- Original data: [`NuInsSeg/human_spleen/`](NuInsSeg/human_spleen/)
- Images: RGB tissue microscopy images.
- Masks: Binary ground truth segmentation labels.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Libraries** (automatically installed):
  - `torch`, `torchvision` (PyTorch)
  - `PIL` (image handling)
  - `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-image` (data processing & visualization)
- **Hardware**: GPU recommended (CUDA-enabled) but not required. CPU will be slower.
- **Time**: ~30-45 minutes.

## Quick Start

### Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Click the badge below to open the notebook in Colab:
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13U6g9ZiqGMeHWACSNUhqWODf-7SNMztC?usp=sharing)

2. Clone the repository to access the dataset and helper modules:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/KikuchiJun1/MicroTas-2026-Workshop-10-Segmentation.git
   %cd MicroTas-2026-Workshop-10-Segmentation
   ```

3. Run all notebook cells in order. 
   - **GPU recommended** (Colab provides free GPU access)
   - **CPU sufficient** (Model size and dataset are small, so still should be sufficient for this notebook)

## Notebook Structure

The main notebook [`Segmentation_Tutorial_Classical_and_UNet.ipynb`](Segmentation_Tutorial_Classical_and_UNet.ipynb) is organized into sections:

1. **Setup**: Configure paths, device (GPU/CPU), and parameters.
2. **Data Discovery**: Preview images and masks from NuInsSeg.
3. **Classical Segmentation**: 
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Otsu thresholding
   - Morphological operations (opening/closing)
   - Evaluation: Dice and IoU metrics
4. **UNet Training**:
   - Build and train a small UNet for 10 epochs
   - Validation loop with metrics
   - Save best checkpoint
5. **Inference**:
   - Load pretrained weights
   - Run predictions on test images
   - Visualize results

## Key Parameters

You can customize the tutorial by modifying these parameters in the notebook:

- **`LIMIT`**: Number of image/mask pairs to use. Default: 40 (fast). Increase to 100+ for better results.
- **`IMG_SIZE`**: Image resolution. Default: 256 (balanced speed/quality).
- **`EPOCHS`**: Training epochs. Default: 10 (quick demo).
- **`BATCH_SIZE`**: Samples per batch. Default: 4.
- **`INCLUDE`**: Dataset subsets to use. Default: `['human_spleen']`.

To run a longer training:
```python
LIMIT = 200      # Use more images
EPOCHS = 20      # Train longer
IMG_SIZE = 512   # Higher resolution
```

## Expected Results

After running the notebook, you should see:

1. **Classical Method Performance**: Dice ~0.7-0.85, IoU ~0.5-0.75 (fast, simple).
2. **UNet Performance**: Dice ~0.85-0.95, IoU ~0.75-0.90 (better, with learning).
3. **Training Plots**: Loss curves showing convergence.
4. **Example Predictions**: Side-by-side visualizations of input image, predicted mask, and ground truth.

```

## Troubleshooting

### **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'train_unet'"**
   - Ensure you cloned the full repository and are in the correct directory.
   - In Colab: Run `!git clone` and `%cd` as shown above.

### **"No GPU available / CUDA not detected"**
   - On Colab: Enable GPU by going to **Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU**.
   - On local machine: Install `pytorch-cuda` (e.g., `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`).
   - The code will still run on CPU, but slower.

### **"NuInsSeg dataset not found"**
   - Ensure the `NuInsSeg/` folder is in the repository root.
   - If using Colab, `git clone` includes it; no extra steps needed.

### **"Out of memory (OOM) error"**
   - Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` (e.g., 2 or 1).
   - Reduce `IMG_SIZE` (e.g., 128).
   - Reduce `LIMIT` (fewer images).

### **Notebook cells fail to run**
   - Restart the kernel: **Kernel → Restart Kernel & Clear Output**.
   - Re-run cells from the top in order.
